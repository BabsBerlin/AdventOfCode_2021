# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„


I started with the goal to get a bit further than last year, when I quit after day 8.<br>
Thanks to our amazing community at Le Wagon and the motivation of my batch mates F and D I was able to finish all puzzles. 

I tried to publish as much as I can here, but some files are still a mess and some code here could use some refactoring as well, I'll try to clean up everything before Dec 2022 ðŸŽ„
